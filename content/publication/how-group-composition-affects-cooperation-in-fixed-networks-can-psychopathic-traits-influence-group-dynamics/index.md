abstract: |-
  Static networks have been shown to foster cooperation for
  specific cost –benefit ratios and numbers of connections
  across a series of interactions. At the same time, psychopathic
  traits have been discovered to predict defective behaviours in
  game theory scenarios. This experiment combines these two
  aspects to investigate how group cooperation can emerge
  when changing group compositions based on psychopathic
  traits. We implemented a modified version of the Prisoner’s
  Dilemma game which has been demonstrated theoretically
  and empirically to sustain a constant level of cooperation
  over rounds. A sample of 190 undergraduate students played
  in small groups where the percentage of psychopathic traits
  in each group was manipulated. Groups entirely composed
  of low psychopathic individuals were compared with
  communities with 50% high and 50% low psychopathic
  players, to observe the behavioural differences at the group
  level. Results showed a significant divergence of the mean
  cooperation of the two conditions, regardless of the small
  range of participants’ psychopathy scores. Groups with a
  large density of high psychopathic subjects cooperated
  significantly less than groups entirely composed of low
  psychopathic players, confirming our hypothesis that
  psychopathic traits affect not only individuals’ decisions but
  also the group behaviour. This experiment highlights how
  differences in group composition with respect to
  psychopathic traits can have a significant impact on group
  dynamics, and it emphasizes the importance of individual
  characteristics when investigating group behaviours
