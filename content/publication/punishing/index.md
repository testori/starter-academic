Sharing negative gossip has been found to be pivotal for
fostering cooperation in social groups. The positive function
gossip serves for groups suggests that gossipers should be
rewarded for sharing useful information. In contrast, gossip
is commonly perceived negatively, meaning that gossipers
incur more social costs than benefits. To solve this puzzle,
we argue that whether receivers interpret gossip as stemming from pro-social versus pro-self motives shapes their
reactions towards gossipers. We conducted a pre-registered
experimental vignette study (n = 1188) in which participants
received negative gossip statements, which we manipulated
to reflect either pro-self or pro-social motives. Supporting our predictions, receivers were more likely to mistakenly interpret negative pro-social gossip as stemming from
pro-self motives than vice versa. Nevertheless, receivers
with a higher ability to overcome intuition were better able
to correctly interpret negative gossip as driven by pro-self
and pro-social motives. Furthermore, results showed that
when receivers interpreted negative gossip as pro-socially
(vs. pro-selfishly) motivated, they trusted gossipers more
and gossip targets less (for behavioral as well as attitudinal
measures of trust).
