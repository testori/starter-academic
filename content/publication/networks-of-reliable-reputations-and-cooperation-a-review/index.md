  Reputation has been shown to provide an informal solution to the problem
    of cooperation in human societies. After reviewing models that connect
    reputations and cooperation, we address how reputation results from information
    exchange embedded in a social network that changes endogenously
    itself. Theoretical studies highlight that network topologies have different
    effects on the extent of cooperation, since they can foster or hinder the flow
    of reputational information. Subsequently, we review models and empirical
    studies that intend to grasp the coevolution of reputations, cooperation and
    social networks. We identify open questions in the literature concerning how
    networks affect the accuracy of reputations, the honesty of shared information
    and the spread of reputational information. Certain network topologies
    may facilitate biased beliefs and intergroup competition or in-group identity
    formation that could lead to high cooperation within but conflicts between
    different subgroups of a network. Our review covers theoretical, experimental
    and field studies across various disciplines that target these questions
    and could explain how the dynamics of interactions and reputations help or
    prevent the establishment and sustainability of cooperation in small- and
    large-scale societies.
