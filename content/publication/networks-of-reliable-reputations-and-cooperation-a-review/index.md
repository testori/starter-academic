abstract: |-
  Reputation has been shown to provide an informal solution to the problem
  of cooperation in human societies. After reviewing models that connect
  reputations and cooperation, we address how reputation results from information
  exchange embedded in a social network that changes endogenously
  itself. Theoretical studies highlight that network topologies have different
  effects on the extent of cooperation, since they can foster or hinder the flow
  of reputational information. Subsequently, we review models and empirical
  studies that intend to grasp the coevolution of reputations, cooperation and
  social networks. We identify open questions in the literature concerning how
  networks affect the accuracy of reputations, the honesty of shared information
  and the spread of reputational information. Certain network topologies
  may facilitate biased beliefs and intergroup competition or in-group identity
  formation that could lead to high cooperation within but conflicts between
  different subgroups of a network. Our review covers theoretical, experimental
  and field studies across various disciplines that target these questions
  and could explain how the dynamics of interactions and reputations help or
  prevent the establishment and sustainability of cooperation in small- and
  large-scale societies.
