abstract: "The omnipresence of workplace gossip makes understanding gossip
  processes imperative to understand social life in organizations. Although
  gossip research has recently increased across the social sciences, gossip is
  conceptualized in disparate ways in the scientific literature. This conceptual
  confusion impedes theoretical integration and providing practical advice. To
  resolve this, we systematically reviewed 6114 scientific articles on gossip
  and identified 324 articles that define gossip. From these definitions, we
  extracted two essential characteristics of gossip on which there seems to be
  agreement within the literature, namely, (1) that gossip is communication
  between humans involving a sender, a receiver, and a target, and (2) that the
  target is absent or unaware of the communicated content. These two
  characteristics formed the basis of a broad, integrative definition of gossip:
  a sender communicating to a receiver about a target who is absent or unaware
  of the content. Furthermore, some definitions include characteristics on which
  there is less agreement: gossip valence (from negative to neutral to positive)
  and formality (from informal to intermediate to formal). We incorporate these
  characteristics in a dimensional scaling framework that can guide future
  research. Our broad, integrative definition of gossip and the dimensional
  scaling framework provide the building blocks for a systematic, integrated
  knowledge base on the role of gossip in human social life in general as well
  as in organizations. This can foster future theory development and hypothesis
  testing, ultimately helping organizations to manage gossip."
