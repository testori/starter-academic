abstract: Personality traits have been long recognized to have a strong impact
  on human decision-making. In this study, a sample of 314 participants took
  part in an online game to investigate the impact of psychopathic traits on
  cooperative behavior in an iterated Prisoner’s dilemma game. We found that
  disinhibition decreased the maintenance of cooperation in successive plays,
  but had no effect on moving toward cooperation after a previous defection or
  on the overall level of cooperation over rounds. Furthermore, our results
  underline the crucial importance of a good model selection procedure, showing
  how a poor choice of statistical model can provide misleading results.
