abstract: While cooperation and risk aversion are considered to be
  evolutionarily advantageous in many circumstances, and selfish or risky
  behaviour can bring negative consequences for individuals and the community at
  large, selfish and risk-seeking behaviour is still often observed in human
  societies. In this paper we consider whether there are environmental and
  social conditions that favour selfish risk-seeking individuals within a
  community and whether tolerating such individuals may provide benefits to the
  community itself in some circumstances. We built an agent-based model
  including two types of agent—selfish risk-seeking and generous
  risk-averse—that harvest resources from the environment and share them (or
  not) with their community. We found that selfish risk-seekers can outperform
  generous risk-averse agents in conditions where their survival is moderately
  challenged, supporting the theory that selfish and risk-seeking traits
  combined are not dysfunctional but rather can be evolutionarily advantageous
  for agents. The benefit for communities is less clear, but when generous
  agents are unconditionally cooperative communities with a greater proportion
  of selfish risk-seeking agents grow to a larger population size suggesting
  some advantage to the community overall.
