abstract: "In the last thirty years, trust has gained momentum across fields, from economics, psychology and
sociology to philosophy and political science. The complexity of the notion has greatly grown, and
various conceptualisations of trust have been at the centre of heated academic debates. On the other
hand, the three-part formalisation of the trust relation, i.e., “A trusts B to do X”, has remained mostly
unchanged over the years. This “classic formalisation” relies on a case-by-case approach whereby we
trust one individual at the time in regard to one specific action. As a result, trust towards groups of
people can be established only by evaluating the expected trustworthiness of the vast majority of the
individuals in the group, which is often unfeasible. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that trust
towards large groups (e.g., our fellow citizens, the government, etc.) frequently occurs and it
meaningfully correlates with other theoretically pertinent concepts. To overcome this ambiguity, we
extend the classical formalisation of trust assuming that people adopt a deductive, top-down
approach to relate with their social surroundings. We propose a category-based formalisation of the
trust relation, whereby people classify others on the basis of a set of properties and formulate
expectations about their reliability. As such, our formalisation encapsulates and expands the classic
formalisation, proposing an annotation of the trust relation that encompasses both particular and
general forms of trust."
