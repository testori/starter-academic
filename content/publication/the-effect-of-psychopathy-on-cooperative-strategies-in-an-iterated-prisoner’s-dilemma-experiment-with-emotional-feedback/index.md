abstract: As decision-making research becomes more popular, the inclusion of
  personality traits has emerged as a focal point for an exhaustive analysis of
  human behaviour. In this study, we investigate the impact of psychopathic
  traits on cooperation in an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game with emotional
  facial feedback. Firstly, we observed how receiving a facial feedback after
  each decision affected players with different psychopathic trait scores, and
  how being informed about the opponent’s identity influenced cooperative
  behaviour. Secondly, we analysed the strategies adopted by each player, and
  how these choices were correlated with their psychopathic traits. Although our
  results showed no effect of different emotional content in the feedback on
  cooperation, we observed more cooperative behaviours in those players who were
  told their opponent was another fellow human, compared to those who were told
  it was a computer. Moreover, fearless dominance had a very small but
  consistent negative effect on overall cooperation and on the tendency to
  maintain cooperative behaviours. We also found that players’ personality
  scores affected the strategies they chose to play throughout the game. Hence,
  our experiment adds complexity to the body of work investigating psychopathic
  traits and social interactions, considering not only the environment of facial
  feedback but also the role of deception in experimental games.
