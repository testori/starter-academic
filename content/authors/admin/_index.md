bio: I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences from University of Southampton
  in 2019. I employe both empirical and computational models to study the
  evolution of cooperation and the role of reputation and gossip in promoting
  prosociality.

My primary research interest focuses on human cooperation in the context of social dilemmas both at the individual and collective level. In particular, I focus on understanding how exogenous (e.g. group composition, organisational/network structure, information flow, gossip) and endogenous (e.g. personality traits) factors improve or deplete cooperation. 

I employ both experimental methods and mathematical models (agent-based models) to investigate cooperative dynamics at both the individuals and the collective level.
