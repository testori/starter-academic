I am a computational social scientist studying how different means can be used to sustain cooperative and sustainable behaviours. 
I look at how information, including gossip, and reputation impacts cooperation in groups and communities. 
I am is also interested in how different interventions can promote more pro-environmental behaviours and the achievement of sustainable development. 
I use experimental methods and agent-based modelling to investigate cooperative and socially sustainable dynamics at the individual and collective level.
