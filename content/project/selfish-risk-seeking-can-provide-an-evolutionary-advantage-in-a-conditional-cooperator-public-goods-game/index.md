While cooperation and risk aversion are considered to be evolutionarily
advantageous in many circumstances, and selfish or risky behaviour
can bring negative consequences for individuals and the community
at large, selfish and risk-seeking behaviour is still often observed
in human societies. In this paper we consider whether there are
environmental and social conditions that favour selfish risk-seeking individuals
within a community and whether tolerating such individuals
may provide benefits to the community itself in some circumstances.
We built an agent-based model including two types of agent - selfish
risk-seeking and generous risk-averse - that harvest resources from the
environment and share them (or not) with their community. We found
that selfish risk-seekers can outperform generous risk-averse agents in
conditions where their survival is moderately challenged, supporting
the theory that selfish and risk-seeking traits combined are not dysfunctional
but rather can be evolutionarily advantageous for agents.
The benefit for communities is less clear, but when generous agents are
unconditionally cooperative communities with a greater proportion of
selfish risk-seeking agents grow to a larger population size suggesting
some advantage to the community overall.
