Gossip, defined as “a sender communicating to a receiver about target who is absent or unaware of the content” (Dores Cruz, Nieper, Testori, Martinescu & Beersma, 2021), is a ubiquitous phenomenon in our daily life: People gossip to warn others, to bond with their friends, to gain personal visibility etc.

Several empirical studies have highlighted how gossip is an efficient and effective tool to foster and maintain cooperation (Feinberg, Willer, Stellar, & Keltner, 2012; Wu, Balliet, & Van Lange, 2015; Wu, Balliet, & Van Lange, 2016).

A recent theoretical paper has highlighted a major lack in the literature studying gossip consequences (Lees & Barnes, 2020). To comprehensively understand gossip consequences, scholars are urged to examine how the perception of gossip by the hand of the receiver impact the consequences of gossip towards both the target and the sender of the statement.

In this project, we investigate how gossip motives (Beersma & Van Kleef, 2011; Dores Cruz et al., 2019), as perceived by the receiver, affect the receiver’s propensity to cooperate towards the target and the sender of the gossip.
