The willingness to engage in costly punishment of free-riders is crucial to foster group cooperation. Yet, overcoming this second-order social dilemma can be costly for both individuals and groups. While prior studies show that prosocial punishment is a frequent phenomenon across different societies, the underlying motivations remain less understood. Scholars have suggested that individuals have a tendency to resist inequitable outcomes and are willing to bear significant costs to sanction free-riders, aiming for a more equal distribution of payoffs. Inequality aversion, however, cannot be experimentally manipulated and past empirical studies have struggled to assess the causal link. In this study, we evaluate this relationship by testing a key implication of fairness-driven theoretical arguments:   
if inequality aversion is the main motivation behind prosocial punishment, individuals should spend less on costly punishment in the presence of redistribution, as their need for establishing equality across individuals should have already been satisfied. We ran a pre-registered 2x2 between-subjects lab experiment where participants (N=320) completed a Social Value Orientation (SVO) task and played a one-shot Public Goods Game (PGG) followed by a Punishment Stage. We manipulated the level of inequality of the endowments and the presence of a Redistributive Taxation Stage after the PGG. Testing our pre-registered hypotheses, we find that (1) inequality aversion (measured through the SVO) does not predict prosocial punishment; (2) the average level of prosocial punishment is not statistically different across treatments. However, our exploratory analysis shows that, when exogenous inequality is high, redistributive taxation affects prosocial punishment depending on others’ wealth. Overall, these results suggest that inequality aversion may trigger prosocial punishment when inequality exceeds a certain level.
