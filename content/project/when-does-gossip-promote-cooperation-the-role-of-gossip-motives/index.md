This study analyzes how public discourse (or gossip) about climate activists influences public support for measures against climate change.
In a prior study (Simpson et al., 2022), neutral reports about radical climate activists’ behaviors were found to increase willingness to support moderate climate activists. However, media reports often portray climate activists in a negative light, leaving the impact on people’s support for action against climate change unclear. Since Simpson et al. (2022) focused on self-reported willingness, insights into effects on actual behavior are missing.
