Humans are often shown to cooperate with one another. Most of the mechanisms
that foster cooperation among humans rely on reputation, which itself relies on the
acquisition of information about other people’s behaviors. Gossip has been proposed
as a cheap yet efficient tool to acquire information, and it has largely been proved to
be an effective means to foster and maintain cooperation. However, empirical studies
supporting this claim have ignored two aspects: (1) they often compared gossip
to conditions in which no reputation was available, impeding a direct assessment of
whether it is gossip that promotes cooperation or rather the introduction of a reputation
system; and (2) they focused on pro-social gossip (e.g., gossip aimed at helping the
receiver), neglecting the impact of other types of gossip. We show here that, in contrast
with the widespread notion that gossip promotes cooperation, gossip mostly depletes
cooperation compared to first-hand information. If lying is fruitful for individuals or
if a group’s behavior is largely uncooperative, gossip leads to negative reputational
information and decreased cooperation.
