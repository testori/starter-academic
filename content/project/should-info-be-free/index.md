A core tenet underpinning the design of contemporary social media
platforms is that users should not be constrained in the amount of
information they can freely and willingly exchange with one another
about a given topic. By means of a computational agent-based model,
we show how even in groups of fully rational, truth-seeking, and
cooperative agents, designs implementing unconstrained informa-
tion exchange may lead to detrimental effects on the correctness
of a group’s beliefs. If unconstrained information exchange can be
detrimental even under such idealized assumptions, it is prudent to
assume it can also be so in practice We therefore argue that con-
straints on information flow should be carefully considered in the
design of communication networks with substantial societal impact,
such as social media platforms.
