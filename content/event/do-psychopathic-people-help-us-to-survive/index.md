  The evolutionary framework of psychopathic traits has been broadly discussed

  in the literature. This paper aims at bringing a new perspective to

  the analysis of the evolutionary adaptiveness of psychopathic traits through

  the use of an agent-based model. The model presented here focuses on some

  of the most defining aspects of psychopathy, namely selfishness, risk-seeking

  attitudes and anti-social behaviours, and explores whether these traits are

  evolutionarily advantageous when both environmental and social conditions

  vary. We modelled two agent types: selfish risk-seekers and generous riskaverse

  individuals. Our model show that selfish risk-seekers outperform generous

  risk-averse individual when the combination of social and environmental

  conditions is moderately challenging. Results support the theory that

  key aspects of psychopathic traits are not dysfunctional but rather evolutionarily

  advantageous for individuals.
