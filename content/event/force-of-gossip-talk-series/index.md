title: Force of Gossip Talk Series
abstract: "We are happy to announce the Force of Gossip Talk Series â€“ Spring
  2021.

  \\

  The event consists of 6 bi-weekly 1-hour sessions. Each session comprises
  two blitz talks (5/7 minutes talk & 10/8 minutes discussion) and one keynote
  talk (20 minutes talk & 10 minutes discussion).

  The series is organised by the Force of Gossip team
  (https://www.fsw.vu.nl/nl/onderzoek/onderzoeksprojecten/force-gossip/index.as\
  px ) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (PI Bianca Beersma).

  \\

  In these talks, we aim to provide an international and interdisciplinary
  space to discuss recent developments in the study of gossip and reputation on
  cooperation. Our goal is to create a community in which to share our work and
  hopefully foster future collaborations. The series will feature speakers from
  different disciplines (psychology, sociology and economics) and we are
  particularly committed to encouraging early career researchers to share their
  work giving them space to present in our blitz talks.

  \\

  Talks will be held every second Thursday at 16.00 CET (Amsterdam)/ 15.00 GMT
  (London)/ 10.00 EST (New York)/ 23.00 CST (Shanghai). Please find attached the
  Program for Spring 2021.
