abstract: Static networks have been shown to foster cooperation for   specific
  cost –benefit ratios and numbers of connections   across a series of
  interactions. At the same time, psychopathic   traits have been discovered to
  predict defective behaviours in   game theory scenarios. This experiment
  combines these two   aspects to investigate how group cooperation can
  emerge   when changing group compositions based on psychopathic   traits. We
  implemented a modified version of the Prisoner’s   Dilemma game which has been
  demonstrated theoretically   and empirically to sustain a constant level of
  cooperation   over rounds. A sample of 190 undergraduate students played   in
  small groups where the percentage of psychopathic traits   in each group was
  manipulated. Groups entirely composed   of low psychopathic individuals were
  compared with   communities with 50% high and 50% low psychopathic   players,
  to observe the behavioural differences at the group   level. Results showed a
  significant divergence of the mean   cooperation of the two conditions,
  regardless of the small   range of participants’ psychopathy scores. Groups
  with a   large density of high psychopathic subjects
  cooperated   significantly less than groups entirely composed of
  low   psychopathic players, confirming our hypothesis that   psychopathic
  traits affect not only individuals’ decisions but   also the group behaviour.
  This experiment highlights how   differences in group composition with respect
  to   psychopathic traits can have a significant impact on group   dynamics,
  and it emphasizes the importance of individual   characteristics when
  investigating group behaviours
